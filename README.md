Button Fun (Version 2)
==================

This is a code test that was thrown at me at the very end of an mobile engineering interview at ESPN and I threw this demo app together within 20 minutes.  

What you're seeing here is a version I shipped a day after I concluded the interview.  I spent another 20 minutes (during my plane ride home) getting rid of a dependency on UIButtons (which was the "do this without bonus points" extra credit) and then 5 minutes the following day when I realized the status bar wasn't removed.  

I also made this version non-rotatable, so when the iPad / iPhone is rotated, it just stays oriented in the horizontal position and doesn't need to have squares rearranged, which would certainly go beyond the scope of the programming assignment.

Here are the requirements as they were listed on the sheet of paper in front of me. This would certainly be a fun code test to give to any potential iOS candidate:

## iOS Survey

Requirements:

- Develop a universal iOS app with no status bar with the name "Button Fun"
- Fill the screen with 40 px x 40 px random colored squares laid out in a grid.
- When the user presses a square, change the color of the square to a new one.

Bonus points, try not to use UIButtons.
